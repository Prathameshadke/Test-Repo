what is branch?
A separate copy of your code where you can work safely without affecting others.

git branch <branch name> creating a branch
git switch <branch name> to switch the branch

what do you think so this is a test branch,
so the changes made here wont reflect in main branch untill we merge it!!!

Not happening !!!!
